	- updated the application auto-configuration to better detect when failure is due to user not having access to the app under consideration
	- added code to refresh the token while a job is running rather than relying on 48h tokens
	- added code to check the status of executeHost before submitting the job and failing with a useful error message. The service is capable of accepting jobs into primary queue while hosts are down, so this is a configurable behavior for the adapter
	- removed the io and app search codes and moved them to their own modules
	- increase polling time a bit to lessen load on service
	- enforce processorCount=1 for SERIAL jobs
	- enforce configurable maximum for number of cores
